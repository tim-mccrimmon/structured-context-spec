title: "SCD Structure and Semantics"
version: "0.1.0"
description: >
  Defines what a Structured Context Document (SCD) is, its structure,
  required properties, the three tiers (meta, standards, project),
  and how SCDs enable structured, versionable, and governable context.

  definition:
    what: >
      A Structured Context Document (SCD) is the atomic unit of structured context.
      SCDs provide machine-readable, versionable, and governable representations
      of system context across conceptual, standards, and implementation tiers.
    purpose: >
      SCDs make implicit knowledge explicit, enabling AI agents and tools to
      reason about systems consistently, trace requirements to implementations,
      and support autonomic governance.
    characteristics:
      - "Modular: Each SCD addresses a specific concern"
      - "Hierarchical: SCDs belong to tiers (meta, standards, project)"
      - "Versionable: Each SCD has independent version history"
      - "Relational: SCDs link to other SCDs via typed relationships"
      - "Traceable: Provenance tracks authorship and decisions"
      - "Governable: Supports validation and compliance checking"

  tiers:
    - id: tier:meta
      name: "Meta-Tier"
      description: >
        Defines the conceptual foundation and semantic vocabulary of systems.
        Meta-tier SCDs establish the language used to describe systems.
      id_pattern: "scd:meta:*"
      type_value: "meta"
      scope: "System-wide conceptual structures, not implementation details"
      examples:
        - "SCD-META: Defines SCD structure"
        - "BUNDLE-META: Defines bundle organization"
        - "DOMAIN-META: Defines prescribed domains"

    - id: tier:standards
      name: "Standards-Tier"
      description: >
        Represents external standards, regulations, and compliance frameworks.
        Standards-tier SCDs import obligations that projects must satisfy.
      id_pattern: "scd:standards:*"
      type_value: "standards"
      scope: "Regulatory requirements, certifications, organizational policies"
      examples:
        - "HIPAA Privacy Rule requirements"
        - "SOC2 Type II controls"
        - "ISO 27001 requirements"

    - id: tier:project
      name: "Project-Tier"
      description: >
        Defines the specific system being built. Project-tier SCDs describe
        architecture, components, features, and how standards are satisfied.
      id_pattern: "scd:project:*"
      type_value: "project"
      scope: "Specific system architecture, modules, quality attributes"
      examples:
        - "System context and boundaries"
        - "Technology stack and components"
        - "Security architecture"
