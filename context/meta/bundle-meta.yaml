  Defines what an SCS Bundle is, the five bundle types (project, meta,

  lifecycle management.

    what: >
      An SCS Bundle is a manifest document that organizes and references
      Structured Context Documents (SCDs). Bundles are NOT SCDs themselves—
      they are container documents similar to Docker manifests or Kubernetes
      pod specifications.
    purpose: >
      Bundles provide the organizational structure for SCDs, defining what
      context is active for a project, managing imports and dependencies,
      and serving as immutable contracts for development and governance.
    key_principle: "Bundles are manifests. SCDs are content. They are separate document types."
    analogy:
      docker_k8s: "Bundles are like Docker manifests; SCDs are like layers"
      description: >
        Just as Docker manifests organize layers without being layers themselves,
        SCS bundles organize SCDs without being SCDs.

    Foundational META SCD defining the structure and organization of bundles.
    Bundles are the container mechanism that organizes SCDs into coherent,
    versionable, and governable units.
