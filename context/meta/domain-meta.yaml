  Defines the concept of domains (industry verticals) and concerns
  (functional areas) in SCS. Describes the Software Development domain
  as a reference implementation with 11 concern bundles, and how domain
  experts can create domains for their professions.

    domain:
      what: >
        A domain is an industry vertical or professional practice area for which
        SCS provides structured context support. Examples: Software Development,
        Legal, Clinical, Financial, Trading, Sales.
      purpose: >
        Domains enable professionals across all industries to create structured
        context frameworks tailored to their field's vocabulary, concerns, and
        compliance requirements.
      domain_bundles: >
        Each domain is represented by a domain bundle (type: domain) that imports
        concern bundles relevant to that industry. Domain bundles do NOT contain
        SCDs directly - they organize concerns.
      creation: >
        Domains are created by domain experts in their respective fields, not by
        SCS maintainers. SCS provides the platform; domain experts provide the
        expertise.

    concern:
      what: >
        A concern is a functional area or cross-cutting aspect of work within a domain.
        Examples: Architecture, Security (software); Case Management (legal);
        Treatment Planning (clinical).
      purpose: >
        Concerns organize project-tier SCDs by functional area, enabling focused
        work streams and parallel development.
      concern_bundles: >
        Each concern is represented by a concern bundle (type: concern) containing
        1+ project-tier SCDs. Concern bundles MUST NOT import other bundles.
      reusability: >
        Concerns can be reused across multiple domains. For example, Security concerns
        are relevant to Software Development, Legal, and Clinical domains.

    description: >
      The Software Development domain is the reference implementation for SCS 0.3.
      It demonstrates how to structure a domain with concern bundles. Other professional
      domains (Legal, Clinical, Financial) will be created by domain experts.

          - "Financial Reporting"
    platform_model: >
      SCS provides the architecture; domain experts create domains for their
      professions. Domains are defined using domain manifests that specify
      concerns, content schemas, templates, and validation rules.

  bundle_rules:
    domain_bundles:
      type: "domain"
      import_constraint: "MUST import at least 1 concern bundle"
      scd_constraint: "MUST NOT contain SCDs directly (scds: [])"
      location: "bundles/domains/"
      example: "bundle:software-development"
    concern_bundles:
      type: "concern"
      import_constraint: "MUST NOT import other bundles (imports: [])"
      scd_constraint: "MUST contain at least 1 project-tier SCD"
      location: "bundles/concerns/"
      versioning: "Concern bundles MAY version independently"
      example: "bundle:architecture"

  organization:
    hierarchy: "Project → Domains → Concerns → SCDs"
    parallel_development: "Concern teams can work independently and version separately"
    domain_reuse: "Projects can import multiple domains (e.g., software-development + clinical)"
    concern_reuse: "Concerns can be shared across domains (e.g., Security)"

  rationale: >
    Foundational META SCD defining domains (industry verticals) and concerns
    (functional areas) in SCS 0.3. Updated from 0.2 model where "domain" meant
    functional areas. Now "domain" = industry vertical (Software Development,
    Legal, Clinical), and "concern" = functional area (Architecture, Security).
    Software Development domain serves as reference implementation with 11 concerns.
    This multi-domain architecture enables SCS to support all professional fields.
