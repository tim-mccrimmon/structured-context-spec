  cli_package:
    name: "scs-tools"
    installation: "pip install scs-tools"
    source: "Python package"
    status: "Operational (v0.3)"

  commands:
    init:
      command: "scs init"
      purpose: "Initialize SCS in an existing project"
      what_it_does:
        - "Creates /bundles/ directory"
        - "Creates /scds/ directory with tier subdirectories (meta, standards, project)"
        - "Creates initial .scsconfig file (if applicable)"
      example: |
        cd my-project
        scs init
        # Creates directory structure

    new:
      command: "scs new <project-name>"
      purpose: "Create new project with SCS scaffolding"
      options:
        - "--type <template>"
        - "Templates: healthcare, fintech, saas, government, minimal, standard"
      what_it_does:
        - "Creates new project directory"
        - "Initializes SCS structure"
        - "Creates template bundles for chosen type"
      example: |
        scs new my-healthcare-app --type healthcare
        # Creates project with healthcare templates

    bundle_create:
      command: "scs bundle create"
      purpose: "Create a new bundle manifest"
      interactive: true
      prompts:
        - "Bundle ID (e.g., bundle:my-project)"
        - "Bundle type (meta, standards, domain, concern, project)"
        - "Version (DRAFT or X.Y.Z)"
        - "Title"
        - "Description"
      creates: "Bundle YAML file in /bundles/"
      example: |
        scs bundle create
        # Interactive prompts guide bundle creation

    validate:
      command: "scs validate <path>"
      purpose: "Validate bundle or SCD structure"
      modes:
        loose:
          description: "Default mode for Phase 1 (DRAFT)"
          validates:
            - "YAML structure"
            - "Required fields"
            - "Tier organization"
          does_not_validate:
            - "Content completeness"
            - "Strict constraints"

        strict:
          description: "Future mode for Phase 2 (versioned bundles)"
          validates:
            - "All loose checks"
            - "Import graph validity"
            - "Version format"
            - "Bundle type constraints"
            - "No circular dependencies"

      examples: |
        # Validate single bundle
        scs validate bundles/my-project.yaml

        # Validate all bundles
        scs validate bundles/*.yaml

        # Validate SCD
        scs validate scds/project/architecture.yaml

    bundle_version:
      command: "scs bundle version <path> --version <X.Y.Z>"
      purpose: "Lock bundle with semantic version (makes immutable)"
      status: "Future (Phase 2)"
      what_it_does:
        - "Runs strict validation"
        - "Updates version field from DRAFT to X.Y.Z"
        - "Marks bundle as immutable"
        - "Creates git tag (optional)"
      example: |
        scs bundle version bundles/my-project.yaml --version 1.0.0
        # Locks bundle at version 1.0.0

  tips_and_best_practices:
    - tip: "Start with DRAFT version, iterate quickly"
    - tip: "Keep SCDs focused and atomic (one concept per SCD)"
    - tip: "Use descriptive IDs (scd:project:react-conventions, not scd:project:misc)"
    - tip: "Validate frequently during development"
    - tip: "Commit bundles alongside code (they evolve together)"
    - tip: "Use git branches for major context restructuring"
    - tip: "Code review context changes like you code review code"
