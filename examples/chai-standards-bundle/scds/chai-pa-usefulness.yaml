  Governance boundaries for AI prior authorization agents ensuring useful,
  effective criteria matching. Defines turnaround time requirements, policy
  coverage expectations, scope boundaries, and performance monitoring
  obligations after policy updates.

  scope: "Usefulness, Usability, and Efficacy - Prior Authorization Criteria Matching"
  source_url: "https://rai-content.chai.org/en/latest/prior-authorization-ai-supported-criteria-matching/t%26e-framework.html"

  principle: "Usefulness, Usability, and Efficacy"
  principle_summary: >
    AI-supported prior authorization must demonstrably improve the criteria
    matching process while maintaining or exceeding the quality of human review.
    The agent must operate within defined scope boundaries and degrade gracefully
    when policies change.

  requirements:
    - id: "CHAI-PA-USE-001"
      name: "Turnaround Time Compliance"
      description: >
        Agent must process prior authorization requests within CMS-mandated
        turnaround windows. Separately track auto-approved vs. manual review
        pathways to ensure AI routing does not create bottlenecks.
      benchmark: "72 hours for expedited requests, 7 calendar days for standard requests"
      measurement_phase: "pre_and_post_implementation"
      responsible_role: "implementer"
      implementation_guidance: >
        Configure agent to flag requests approaching TAT deadlines.
        Auto-approved pathway should complete significantly faster than
        manual review. Monitor for cases where AI uncertainty causes
        unnecessary routing to manual review, inflating TAT.

    - id: "CHAI-PA-USE-002"
      name: "Policy Coverage Completeness"
      description: >
        Agent must capture all non-judgment policy criteria including
        inclusion/exclusion rules, numeric thresholds, and contraindications.
        Missing or mis-mapped criteria constitute a governance failure.
      benchmark: ">=90% of required criteria represented; <=10% missing or mis-mapped"
      measurement_phase: "pre_implementation"
      responsible_role: "developer"
      implementation_guidance: >
        Maintain a structured inventory of all policy criteria the agent
        evaluates. When policies update, diff against previous version to
        identify new/changed/removed criteria. Flag coverage gaps before
        deploying updated policies to production agents.

    - id: "CHAI-PA-USE-003"
      name: "Scope Boundary Enforcement"
      description: >
        Agent must reject queries outside its defined scope. Clinical
        judgments beyond criteria alignment, treatment recommendations,
        and diagnostic interpretations are out-of-scope and must be
        refused with appropriate routing to human review.
      benchmark: ">=95% correct rejection of out-of-scope queries"
      measurement_phase: "pre_and_post_implementation"
      responsible_role: "developer"
      implementation_guidance: >
        Define explicit scope boundaries in agent context. The agent
        performs CRITERIA MATCHING only — it does not render clinical
        opinions, recommend treatments, or override physician judgment.
        Out-of-scope requests must be routed to human reviewers with
        clear documentation of why the request exceeded agent scope.
      in_scope:
        - "Criteria matching against payer medical necessity guidelines"
        - "Verification of required documentation completeness"
        - "Identification of missing information for criteria evaluation"
        - "Routing recommendations (auto-approve, manual review, deny)"
      out_of_scope:
        - "Clinical judgment or medical opinion"
        - "Treatment recommendations or alternatives"
        - "Diagnostic interpretation"
        - "Override of physician-provided clinical rationale"
        - "Benefit determination beyond criteria matching"

    - id: "CHAI-PA-USE-004"
      name: "Efficiency Improvement"
      description: >
        AI-assisted criteria matching should measurably reduce time-on-task
        compared to fully manual review baseline.
      benchmark: ">=15-30% reduction in time-on-task considered meaningful"
      measurement_phase: "pre_implementation"
      responsible_role: "implementer"

    - id: "CHAI-PA-USE-005"
      name: "Policy Update Resilience"
      description: >
        Agent performance must be monitored after policy updates. Governance
        protocols must define retraining or re-evaluation triggers when
        new or revised coverage policies are deployed.
      benchmark: "No specific threshold — requires governance protocols defining retraining triggers"
      measurement_phase: "post_implementation"
      responsible_role: "developer"
      implementation_guidance: >
        Track all metrics (coverage completeness, scope rejection, TAT)
        before and after policy updates. Define thresholds for acceptable
        degradation. If metrics drop below threshold after policy update,
        halt auto-approval pathway until remediated.

    - id: "CHAI-PA-USE-006"
      name: "Appeal Overturn Rate Monitoring"
      description: >
        Track claims paid only after successful appeals, comparing pre
        and post AI implementation rates. AI should not increase the
        rate of incorrect initial denials.
      benchmark: "Maintain historical baseline during adoption; reduce below pre-AI levels over time"
      measurement_phase: "pre_and_post_implementation"
      responsible_role: "implementer"

  governance_note: >
    CRITICAL: The AI model does not render actual approvals or denials.
    It informs organizational routing logic. The agent's output is a
    criteria matching assessment, not a coverage determination. Final
    decisions remain with authorized human reviewers per organizational
    policy and regulatory requirements.
