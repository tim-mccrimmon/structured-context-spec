content:
  summary: "Medication non-adherence is a $300B healthcare problem affecting patient outcomes"

  problem_statement: |
    50% of patients with chronic conditions do not take medications as prescribed.
    This leads to 125,000 preventable deaths and $300B in avoidable healthcare costs annually.
    Healthcare providers lack visibility into patient adherence between visits.

  root_causes:
    - "Forgetfulness - patients simply forget doses"
    - "Complex regimens - multiple medications at different times"
    - "Lack of feedback - no reinforcement for good behavior"
    - "Provider blind spots - adherence issues discovered too late"

  target_users:
    - "Patients with chronic conditions requiring daily medication"
    - "Healthcare providers managing patient populations"

  desired_outcome: |
    Improve medication adherence rates by 25% through timely reminders,
    easy tracking, and proactive provider alerts for at-risk patients.
