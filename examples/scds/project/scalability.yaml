content:
  summary: "Horizontal scaling to support 100K+ patients"

  capacity_targets:
    year_1: "10,000 patients, 50 healthcare orgs"
    year_2: "50,000 patients, 200 healthcare orgs"
    year_3: "100,000+ patients"

  scaling_approach:
    compute: "ECS auto-scaling based on CPU/memory"
    database: "Read replicas for dashboard queries"
    cache: "Redis cluster for session and hot data"
    queue: "SQS for reminder job distribution"

  bottleneck_mitigations:
    - "Database: Read replicas, connection pooling"
    - "Reminder sending: Parallel workers with rate limiting"
    - "API: Horizontal pod scaling"

  load_testing:
    - "Monthly load tests simulating 2x current capacity"
    - "Chaos engineering exercises quarterly"
