description: >
  Governance boundaries ensuring AI prior authorization decisions are
  explainable, documented, and auditable. Defines model card requirements,
  decision traceability obligations, and documentation standards.

  scope: "Transparency - Prior Authorization Criteria Matching"
  source_url: "https://rai-content.chai.org/en/latest/prior-authorization-ai-supported-criteria-matching/t%26e-framework.html"

  principle: "Transparency"
  principle_summary: >
    AI-supported prior authorization must be transparent about what the
    model does, how it was developed, what data it was trained on, and
    how individual decisions were reached. Stakeholders (providers, patients,
    regulators) must be able to understand why a specific criteria matching
    assessment was made.

  requirements:
    - id: "CHAI-PA-TRANS-001"
      name: "CHAI Applied Model Card"
      description: >
        Developers must complete and maintain a CHAI Applied Model Card
        (or equivalent documentation) for all AI models used in prior
        authorization criteria matching. The model card must be accessible
        to authorized stakeholders.

      name: "Decision Traceability"
      description: >
        Every criteria matching assessment must be traceable to the specific
        policy criteria evaluated, the evidence considered, and the reasoning
        applied. Stakeholders must be able to reconstruct why a specific
        assessment was reached.
      benchmark: "100% of assessments include traceable reasoning"
      measurement_phase: "pre_and_post_implementation"
      responsible_role: "developer"
      implementation_guidance: >
        For each criteria matching assessment, log:
        1. Which policy version was active at the time of assessment
        2. Which specific criteria were evaluated
        3. What evidence (from the request) was matched against each criterion
        4. The assessment outcome for each criterion
        5. The overall routing recommendation and rationale

        This log must be immutable and retained per organizational and
        regulatory retention policies.

    - id: "CHAI-PA-TRANS-003"
      name: "Context Version Auditability"
      description: >
        It must be possible to determine exactly which governance context
        (policies, criteria, thresholds) the AI agent was operating under
        at the time of any specific decision. This enables retrospective
        audit and investigation.
      benchmark: "100% of assessments linked to specific context version"
      measurement_phase: "post_implementation"
      responsible_role: "implementer"
      implementation_guidance: >
        Record the bundle version, tag resolution, and SCD versions
        active at the time of each assessment. When investigating a
        past decision, it must be possible to reconstruct the exact
        governance context the agent had — not just the current context.

  scs_alignment_note: >
    CHAI-PA-TRANS-003 (Context Version Auditability) maps directly to
    SCS/SCP capabilities: immutable versioned bundles, tag-based
    resolution with audit trails, and the Context Service's ability
    to reconstruct what context any agent had at any timestamp. This
    is the strongest alignment point between CHAI's requirements and
    the SCS delivery mechanism.
