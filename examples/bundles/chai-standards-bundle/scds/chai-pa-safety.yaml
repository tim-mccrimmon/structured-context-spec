description: >
  Governance boundaries ensuring AI prior authorization systems are safe,
  reliable, and fail gracefully. Defines failure analysis requirements,
  risk priority thresholds, and system availability obligations.

  scope: "Safety and Reliability - Prior Authorization Criteria Matching"
  source_url: "https://rai-content.chai.org/en/latest/prior-authorization-ai-supported-criteria-matching/t%26e-framework.html"

  principle: "Safety and Reliability"
  principle_summary: >
    AI-supported prior authorization must be resilient, fail safely, and
    undergo rigorous pre-deployment failure analysis. When the system fails
    or encounters uncertainty, it must default to human review rather than
    rendering potentially incorrect determinations.

  requirements:
    - id: "CHAI-PA-SAFE-001"
      name: "Pre-Deployment Failure Analysis"
      description: >
        Apply structured failure analysis methodologies before deploying
        AI criteria matching to production. Must address AI-specific risk
        categories beyond traditional software failure modes.
      benchmark: "Risk Priority Number (RPN) <100 for all critical failure modes"
      measurement_phase: "pre_implementation"
      responsible_role: "developer_and_implementer"
      methodologies:
        - "Fault Tree Analysis (FTA)"
        - "Failure Mode and Effects Analysis (FMEA)"
        - "Root Cause Analysis (RCA)"
      ai_specific_risks:
        - id: "RISK-001"
          category: "Data Drift"
          description: >
            Input data characteristics change over time, causing model
            performance to degrade. Examples: new drug categories, changing
            patient demographics, evolving clinical guidelines.
          mitigation: >
            Monitor input data distributions against training baselines.
            Define drift thresholds that trigger re-evaluation.

        - id: "RISK-002"
          category: "Model Bias"
          description: >
            Systematic errors in criteria matching that correlate with
            demographic characteristics or specific clinical categories.
          mitigation: >
            Cross-reference with CHAI-PA-FAIR-001 (Predictive Parity).
            Include bias detection in failure analysis scope.

        - id: "RISK-003"
          category: "Hallucination"
          description: >
            Agent generates criteria assessments referencing policies,
            guidelines, or clinical evidence that do not exist or are
            misrepresented.
          mitigation: >
            Ground all criteria matching against structured policy documents.
            Require citation of specific policy sections for each criterion
            evaluated. Flag assessments that cannot be traced to source policy.

        - id: "RISK-004"
          category: "Policy Change Impact"
          description: >
            New or revised coverage policies cause unpredictable changes
            in agent behavior. Agent may apply outdated criteria or
            misinterpret new policy language.
          mitigation: >
            Version all policy context. Test agent behavior against new
            policies in staging before production deployment. Monitor
            metrics (per CHAI-PA-USE-005) after each policy update.

      implementation_guidance: >
        Conduct FMEA for each critical failure mode. Calculate Risk Priority
        Number (RPN) as Severity x Occurrence x Detection. Any failure mode
        with RPN >= 100 must be mitigated before production deployment.
        Re-evaluate FMEA quarterly and after significant system changes.

    - id: "CHAI-PA-SAFE-002"
      name: "System Reliability and Availability"
      description: >
        AI criteria matching services must maintain high availability.
        Downtime directly impacts prior authorization processing timelines
        and may cause CMS turnaround time violations.
      benchmark: ">=99.9% system uptime"
      measurement_phase: "pre_and_post_implementation"
      responsible_role: "developer_and_implementer"
      implementation_guidance: >
        Define fallback pathways for when AI service is unavailable.
        All requests must route to manual review during outages — requests
        must never be silently dropped or delayed without notification.
        Monitor uptime continuously and alert on degradation before
        SLA thresholds are breached.

  fail_safe_principle: >
    When the AI system encounters uncertainty, errors, or edge cases
    beyond its defined scope, the default behavior MUST be to route
    to human review. The system must NEVER auto-deny based on inability
    to match criteria. Uncertainty routes to humans, not to denial.
