title: "CHAI - AI-Supported Prior Authorization Criteria Matching"
description: >
  Standards bundle encoding the Coalition for Health AI (CHAI) Best Practice
  Guide and Testing & Evaluation Framework for AI-supported prior authorization
  criteria matching. Based on CHAI's v1.0 release (December 2025), developed
  by 100+ industry experts from UnitedHealth Group, CVS Health, BCBS Minnesota,
  MCG Health, Lyric.ai, Mayo Clinic, Duke, Stanford, and others.

  This bundle provides the governance boundaries that AI agents performing
  prior authorization criteria matching must operate within. It does NOT
  provide workflow logic or operational data — it provides the behavioral
  rules, fairness requirements, safety thresholds, and transparency
  obligations the agent must satisfy.
