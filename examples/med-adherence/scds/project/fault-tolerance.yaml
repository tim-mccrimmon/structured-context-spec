description: "Fault tolerance and graceful degradation strategies"

content:
  summary: "System continues operating despite component failures"

  failure_modes:
    - component: "SMS gateway (Twilio)"
      impact: "Reminders not delivered"
      mitigation: "Queue and retry, fallback to push notification"

    - component: "Database"
      impact: "Service unavailable"
      mitigation: "Multi-AZ failover, read replicas"

    - component: "Auth provider (Auth0)"
      impact: "Cannot authenticate"
      mitigation: "Cached tokens, graceful session extension"

    - component: "Single API instance"
      impact: "Reduced capacity"
      mitigation: "Load balancer routes to healthy instances"

  circuit_breaker_patterns:
    - "External API calls with circuit breaker"
    - "Fallback responses when dependencies unavailable"
    - "Bulkhead isolation for critical vs non-critical paths"

  graceful_degradation:
    - "Dashboard shows cached data if API slow"
    - "Reminders queue if delivery delayed"
    - "Read-only mode if writes failing"
