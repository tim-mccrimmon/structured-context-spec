  launch_timeline:
    target: "Q1 2026 (Week of Jan 13-17)"
    approach: "Soft launch with community building"
    status: "Pre-launch (materials ready)"

  target_audience:
    primary:
      description: "Individual developers using AI coding assistants daily"
      characteristics:
        - "Software engineers (junior to senior)"
        - "Using Claude Code, GitHub Copilot, ChatGPT, Cursor"
        - "Projects with meaningful complexity (>1,000 LOC)"
        - "Frustrated by re-teaching AI, inconsistent responses"
        - "Early adopters, active on GitHub, HN, Reddit"

    secondary:
      description: "Development teams (2-15 people)"
      needs:
        - "Consistency across team members"
        - "Standardize context without losing tool choice"
        - "Version context with code"

    tertiary:
      description: "Open source maintainers"
      needs:
        - "Onboard contributors quickly"
        - "Improve AI-generated PR quality"

  positioning:
    primary_tagline: "Stop Re-Teaching Your AI Every Day"
    alternative_tagline: "Structured Context for AI Systems"
    one_liner: "Package.json for AI context"

    elevator_pitch: |
      SCS is an open source specification for managing AI context. Instead of re-explaining
      your project to Claude every day, you create structured context bundles—YAML files
      with your architecture, conventions, and domain knowledge. Load them into any AI
      (Claude, ChatGPT, Copilot) and your AI operates within your actual boundaries.
      Version with git, share with your team. Free and open source. We use it to build
      SCS itself.

  core_messages:
    problem:
      statement: |
        CLAUDE.md isn't enough. Either it's too vague (AI guesses) or too detailed
        (burns tokens, accumulates conflicts). Both cause architectural drift.

    insight:
      statement: |
        AI doesn't need to be smarter. It needs to be bounded. Without explicit context,
        AI invents reality instead of operating within your constraints.

    solution:
      statement: |
        SCS lets you define structured context bundles—architecture, conventions,
        constraints—in YAML. Version with git, load into any AI, never re-explain.

    credibility:
      statement: |
        We built SCS to solve our own problem. We use SCS to manage SCS development.
        If it works for us, it'll work for you.

    freedom:
      statement: |
        MIT licensed. No cloud service, no vendor lock-in. Your context lives in your
        git repo. Works with any AI tool.

  differentiation:
    vs_claude_md:
      problem: "Unstructured prose, token-heavy, conflicting details"
      scs: "Structured YAML, composable bundles, clear precedence"
      summary: "Think package.json vs. a README"

    vs_rag:
      rag: "Retrieves information on-demand (good for knowledge bases)"
      scs: "Explicit, always-present context (good for architecture, rules, constraints)"
      relationship: "Complementary - RAG for facts, SCS for boundaries"

    vs_prompt_engineering:
      problem: "Ad-hoc context management disguised as technique"
      scs: "Versioned, governed context as infrastructure"

    vs_fine_tuning:
      problem: "Bakes knowledge into model, expensive, slow to update"
      scs: "External context, instant updates, version controlled"

  relationship_to_oicp:
    strategy: "SCS establishes mindshare, validates structured context concept"

    funnel: |
      SCS users who outgrow git-based workflow upgrade to OICP for runtime streaming,
      governance, and scale.

    trigger_points:
      - "Runtime Context: Need AI agents in production to consume context"
      - "Multi-Agent Coordination: 10+ agents need synchronized updates"
      - "Real-Time Updates: Policy changes must propagate in seconds"
      - "Enterprise Governance: Audit trails, compliance tracking"
      - "Team Scale: 50+ developers, coordination overhead unmanageable"

    transition_message: |
      SCS is perfect for dev-time AI and small teams. When you need runtime context
      streaming, governance, and scale—that's OICP.
