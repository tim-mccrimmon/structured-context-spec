    tagline: "Stop Re-Teaching Your AI Every Day"
    description: |
      SCS is an open source specification for defining structured, versioned, composable
      context that AI systems can operate within. It enables developers to define context
      once as machine-readable artifacts, version it with git, and reuse it across any
      AI tool—Claude, ChatGPT, Copilot, or custom implementations.

  the_problem:
    current_state: "Developers use CLAUDE.md (or similar) to give AI context, but it's insufficient"

    the_dilemma:
      too_vague:
        - "High-level guidance without critical details"
        - "AI fills gaps by improvising"
        - "Architectural drift accumulates"
        - "Inconsistent responses across developers"

      too_detailed:
        - "Monolithic documents that burn tokens on every request"
        - "Information accumulates and conflicts over time"
        - "Hard to maintain, harder to validate"
        - "Still unstructured - AI can't reason about precedence"

    outcome: |
      Both paths lead to the same result: AI that invents its own reality instead of
      operating within your actual constraints.

  the_insight:
    core_truth: "AI doesn't need to be smarter. It needs to be bounded."

    explanation: |
      The issue isn't that AI forgets—it's that AI was never given a world to operate in.

      Think about explaining a project to someone who doesn't understand how your
      organization works, what architectural decisions you made, or which patterns you
      follow. AI systems don't interpret against a shared reality—they invent one that
      fits the prompt.

      That's not hallucination. That's working without boundaries.

    the_scope_problem: |
      Context isn't a prompt problem or a memory problem—it's a scope problem. AI needs
      explicit, versioned context defining the operating environment: architecture patterns,
      conventions, constraints, domain knowledge.

  the_martians_analogy:
    setup: |
      Working with AI is like working with Martians—enormously intelligent beings who can
      build almost anything, but with absolutely no understanding of how Earth works.

      No shared assumptions. No cultural context. No intuition about organizations.

      Worse, in their culture, asking clarifying questions is discouraged. If you ask for
      something, they'll build exactly what they think you meant—confidently and efficiently.

    the_problem: |
      Humans miscommunicate because we interpret things differently. AI misbehaves because
      it has nothing to interpret against.

    the_inversion: |
      While rich, structured context can feel heavy to humans, it's actually the easiest
      thing for machines to work with. What feels like bureaucracy to people is clarity
      to an AI system.

    the_goal: |
      The goal isn't to make AI smarter. It's to make AI bounded. Once an AI system has
      a world, intelligence becomes useful. Without one, even the smartest system is just
      improvising.

  the_solution:
    description: |
      SCS provides a specification for defining structured context documents (SCDs) and
      bundles that give AI systems persistent, versioned understanding of their operating
      environment.

    key_capabilities:
      - name: "Structured"
        detail: "Machine-readable YAML format (not prose)"

      - name: "Versioned"
        detail: "Git-native, semantic versioning"

      - name: "Composable"
        detail: "Import and extend shared bundles"

      - name: "LLM-agnostic"
        detail: "Works with Claude, ChatGPT, Copilot, or custom implementations"

      - name: "Infrastructure-free"
        detail: "Files in git, no cloud service required"

  what_scs_is:
    - "A specification for structured context bundles"
    - "LLM-agnostic (works with any AI system)"
    - "Git-native (standard version control workflows)"
    - "Open source (Apache 2.0 license)"

  what_scs_is_not:
    - "Not a model, platform, or hosted service"
    - "Not a replacement for RAG or fine-tuning"
    - "Not vendor-specific or cloud-dependent"
    - "Not focused on runtime agents (dev-time AI focus)"

  target_audience:
    primary:
      description: "Individual developers using AI coding assistants daily"
      characteristics:
        - "Software engineers (junior to senior)"
        - "Using Claude Code, GitHub Copilot, ChatGPT, Cursor"
        - "Working on projects with meaningful complexity (>1,000 LOC)"
        - "Frustrated by re-teaching AI, inconsistent responses, architectural drift"
        - "Early adopters, active on GitHub, HN, Reddit"

    secondary:
      description: "Development teams (2-15 people)"
      needs:
        - "Consistency across team members' AI usage"
        - "Standardize context without losing tool choice"
        - "Version context with code"

    tertiary:
      description: "Open source maintainers"
      needs:
        - "Onboard contributors quickly"
        - "AI-generated PRs follow project patterns"
        - "Reduce PR review overhead"

  use_cases:
    solo_developer:
      problem: "I waste 30 minutes every morning re-teaching Claude my project structure"
      solution: |
        Create project bundle with architecture, conventions, constraints. Version in git.
        Load into Claude once per project. Update bundle when architecture changes.
      benefit: "Define context once, reuse everywhere. Never re-explain your project."

    development_team:
      problem: "Each dev on my team has different context. Code inconsistency is getting worse."
      solution: |
        Tech lead creates shared bundle with team conventions. Bundle versioned in git.
        When architecture changes, update bundle and commit. All team members get updated
        context via git pull.
      benefit: "Consistent code across team. Faster code reviews. Seamless onboarding."

    open_source_project:
      problem: "New contributors use AI to generate PRs but AI doesn't know our architecture."
      solution: |
        Publish project bundle in repo. CONTRIBUTING.md says "Load this bundle into your AI".
        Contributors get correct context immediately.
      benefit: "Onboard contributors in minutes, not weeks. Better PRs from day 1."

  differentiation:
    vs_claude_md:
      problem: "Unstructured prose, token-heavy, conflicting details"
      scs: "Structured YAML, composable bundles, clear precedence"
      analogy: "Think package.json vs. a long README"

    vs_rag:
      rag: "Retrieves information on-demand from knowledge bases"
      scs: "Explicit, always-present context that defines operating boundaries"
      relationship: "They complement each other—RAG for facts, SCS for boundaries"

    vs_prompt_engineering:
      problem: "Ad-hoc context management per request, no versioning, no team sharing"
      scs: "Versioned infrastructure, team shared, validated"

    vs_fine_tuning:
      problem: "Bakes knowledge into model, expensive, slow to update"
      scs: "External context, free, instant updates"

  the_dogfooding_story:
    test: "If SCS can't manage SCS, why would anyone use it?"

    the_problem_we_faced: |
      After 5 weeks of rapid development on OICP, our documentation was chaos:
      - Random markdown files scattered across directories
      - Context drift between development sessions
      - Every morning: 30+ minutes re-teaching Claude our architecture
      - Conflicts and contradictions accumulating

    the_solution_we_built: |
      We created SCS bundles for the SCS project itself. Now contributors can clone the
      repo, load our bundles, and understand SCS architecture in minutes instead of hours.

    before_after:
      before: "30-60 min/day re-teaching context"
      after: "5 min one-time bundle load"

    credibility: "The meta part works. Which means it'll work for your projects too."

  relationship_to_oicp:
    scs_scope: "Open source specification for structured context, git-based, dev-time focused"
    oicp_scope: "Commercial platform that implements SCS, adds runtime streaming, governance"

    connection: |
      SCS is the open specification. OICP is the commercial implementation that adds
      enterprise features: runtime context streaming, multi-agent coordination, perfect
      audit trails, governance.

    funnel: "SCS users who need runtime deployment, governance, and scale → OICP"
