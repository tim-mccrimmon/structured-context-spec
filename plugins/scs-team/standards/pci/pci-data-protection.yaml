content:
  standard: "PCI DSS"
  standard_version: "v4.0"
  scope: "Requirements 3, 4: Protect stored and transmitted cardholder data"

  requirements:
    - id: "PCI-DATA-001"
      description: "Identify and inventory all cardholder data (Req 3.1)"
      implementation_guidance: >
        Map all locations where PAN (Primary Account Number), cardholder name,
        expiration date, and service code are stored, processed, or transmitted.
        Never store sensitive authentication data (CVV, PIN, full magnetic stripe)
        after authorization.
    - id: "PCI-DATA-002"
      description: "Minimize cardholder data storage (Req 3.1)"
      implementation_guidance: >
        Only store cardholder data if there is a legitimate business need.
        Define retention periods and implement automated purging.
        Use tokenization to replace PAN with non-sensitive tokens where possible.
    - id: "PCI-DATA-003"
      description: "Render PAN unreadable when stored (Req 3.5)"
      implementation_guidance: >
        Use one of: one-way hash (SHA-256+), truncation (first 6 / last 4 only),
        index tokens, or strong cryptography (AES-256). If encryption is used,
        key management must follow Req 3.6.
    - id: "PCI-DATA-004"
      description: "Encrypt cardholder data in transit over open networks (Req 4.1)"
      implementation_guidance: >
        Use TLS 1.2+ for all transmission of cardholder data over public networks.
        Do not send unencrypted PAN via email, chat, or SMS.
        Verify TLS certificates and reject invalid certificates.
