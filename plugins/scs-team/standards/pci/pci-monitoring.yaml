  scope: "Requirements 10, 11: Track, monitor, and test"

  requirements:
    - id: "PCI-MON-001"
      description: "Log all access to cardholder data (Req 10.2)"
      implementation_guidance: >
        Log all individual user access to cardholder data, all actions taken
        by anyone with root/admin privileges, access to audit trails,
        invalid access attempts, use of identification and authentication
        mechanisms, and initialization/stopping of audit logs.
    - id: "PCI-MON-002"
      description: "Protect audit trails from tampering (Req 10.5)"
      implementation_guidance: >
        Use file integrity monitoring on log files. Restrict access to logs
        to need-to-know only. Store logs on centralized log server.
        Retain logs for minimum 12 months (3 months immediately available).
    - id: "PCI-MON-003"
      description: "Review logs daily (Req 10.6)"
      implementation_guidance: >
        Review security event logs at least daily. Use automated tools
        (SIEM) to correlate events and flag anomalies. Define and document
        review procedures for each log source.
    - id: "PCI-MON-004"
      description: "Conduct vulnerability scans quarterly (Req 11.3)"
      implementation_guidance: >
        Run internal vulnerability scans at least quarterly and after significant
        changes. Use ASV (Approved Scanning Vendor) for external scans.
        Remediate high/critical vulnerabilities and rescan to verify.
    - id: "PCI-MON-005"
      description: "Conduct penetration testing annually (Req 11.4)"
      implementation_guidance: >
        Perform annual penetration testing of both network and application layers.
        Test both from outside the network and from within. Remediate findings
        and retest to verify. Use qualified penetration testers.
