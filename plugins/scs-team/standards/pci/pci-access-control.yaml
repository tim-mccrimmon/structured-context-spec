  requirements:
    - id: "PCI-ACC-001"
      description: "Restrict access by business need-to-know (Req 7.1)"
      implementation_guidance: >
        Implement role-based access control. Define access needs for each role
        before granting permissions. Default deny - only grant access explicitly
        required for job function. Document and review access policies.
    - id: "PCI-ACC-002"
      description: "Assign unique IDs to all users (Req 8.1)"
      implementation_guidance: >
        Every user must have a unique ID. No shared or group accounts for
        accessing cardholder data environments. Service accounts must be
        individually trackable and have minimal required permissions.
    - id: "PCI-ACC-003"
      description: "Implement multi-factor authentication (Req 8.4)"
      implementation_guidance: >
        Require MFA for all non-console administrative access to the CDE
        and for all remote network access. MFA must use at least two of:
        something you know, something you have, something you are.
    - id: "PCI-ACC-004"
      description: "Manage passwords securely (Req 8.3)"
      implementation_guidance: >
        Minimum 12 characters (or 8 if system doesn't support longer).
        Require complexity (numeric + alpha). Change every 90 days.
        Do not allow reuse of last 4 passwords. Lock out after 10 failed attempts.
