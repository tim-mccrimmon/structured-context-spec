  standard: "CHAI"
  standard_version: "Blueprint for Trustworthy AI (2023)"
  scope: "Transparency, Explainability, and Documentation"

  requirements:
    - id: "CHAI-TR-001"
      description: "Document AI model purpose and intended use"
      implementation_guidance: >
        Clearly state what the AI model does, what clinical decisions it supports,
        and what it should NOT be used for. Include target population,
        intended clinical setting, and expected users (clinician, patient, admin).
    - id: "CHAI-TR-002"
      description: "Disclose training data characteristics"
      implementation_guidance: >
        Document the source, size, and demographic characteristics of training data.
        Identify known gaps in representation. State any data quality limitations
        that may affect model performance in specific populations.
    - id: "CHAI-TR-003"
      description: "Provide model performance metrics"
      implementation_guidance: >
        Report accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, and other relevant metrics.
        Break down performance by demographic subgroups (age, sex, race/ethnicity,
        insurance status). Report confidence intervals where applicable.
    - id: "CHAI-TR-004"
      description: "Enable clinical explainability"
      implementation_guidance: >
        Provide explanations that are meaningful to clinical end users.
        For each prediction/recommendation, show contributing factors.
        Avoid black-box outputs for clinical decisions. Use established
        explainability methods (SHAP, LIME, attention weights) as appropriate.
    - id: "CHAI-TR-005"
      description: "Maintain model card or fact sheet"
      implementation_guidance: >
        Create and maintain a model card documenting: model architecture,
        training process, evaluation results, known limitations, ethical
        considerations, and update history. Make accessible to all stakeholders.

  controls:
    - id: "CHAI-TR-CTRL-001"
      description: "Model documentation completeness"
      evidence_required: "Model card/fact sheet, training data documentation, performance reports by subgroup"
    - id: "CHAI-TR-CTRL-002"
      description: "Explainability implementation"
      evidence_required: "Sample explanations, user testing results showing clinical comprehension, explanation method documentation"
