content:
  standard: "CHAI"
  standard_version: "Blueprint for Trustworthy AI (2023)"
  scope: "Accountability, Bias, Human Oversight, and Validation"

  requirements:
    - id: "CHAI-AC-001"
      description: "Implement bias detection and monitoring"
      implementation_guidance: >
        Test for bias across protected classes (race, sex, age, disability, etc.)
        before deployment and on an ongoing basis. Define acceptable disparity
        thresholds. Implement automated bias monitoring in production.
        Document bias testing methodology and results.
    - id: "CHAI-AC-002"
      description: "Maintain human oversight for clinical decisions"
      implementation_guidance: >
        AI must support clinical decisions, not replace clinical judgment.
        Define which decisions require human review before action.
        Implement clear override mechanisms for clinicians.
        Never automate decisions that require clinical judgment without human-in-the-loop.
    - id: "CHAI-AC-003"
      description: "Conduct clinical validation before deployment"
      implementation_guidance: >
        Validate model performance in the target clinical environment.
        Use prospective validation where possible. Compare AI-assisted outcomes
        with standard of care. Obtain clinical review board approval.
        Document validation methodology, results, and limitations.
    - id: "CHAI-AC-004"
      description: "Implement post-deployment monitoring"
      implementation_guidance: >
        Monitor model performance drift over time. Track adverse events
        and near-misses related to AI recommendations. Implement alerting
        for performance degradation. Conduct periodic re-validation.
        Define triggers for model retraining or retirement.
    - id: "CHAI-AC-005"
      description: "Establish clear accountability chain"
      implementation_guidance: >
        Define who is accountable for AI system outcomes at each level:
        development, deployment, clinical use, and governance.
        Maintain incident reporting process for AI-related adverse events.
        Document escalation paths and decision authority.
