description: "Technical safeguards for access control, audit logging, integrity, and transmission security per HIPAA Security Rule"

content:
  standard: "HIPAA"
  standard_version: "As amended by HITECH Act"
  scope: "Security Rule (45 CFR §164.312)"

  requirements:
    - id: "SEC-001"
      description: "Implement unique user identification for all PHI access"
      implementation_guidance: >
        Every user must have a unique identifier. No shared accounts for PHI access.
        System accounts that access PHI must be individually trackable.
        Reference: §164.312(a)(2)(i)
    - id: "SEC-002"
      description: "Implement emergency access procedures"
      implementation_guidance: >
        Define break-glass procedures for emergency PHI access.
        Emergency access must still be logged and reviewed after the fact.
        Reference: §164.312(a)(2)(ii)
    - id: "SEC-003"
      description: "Implement automatic session termination"
      implementation_guidance: >
        Terminate sessions after period of inactivity (recommend 15 minutes for clinical).
        Require re-authentication to resume.
        Reference: §164.312(a)(2)(iii)
    - id: "SEC-004"
      description: "Encrypt PHI at rest"
      implementation_guidance: >
        Use AES-256 encryption for all stored PHI. This includes database fields,
        file storage, backups, and any cached copies. Key management must follow
        NIST SP 800-57 guidelines.
        Reference: §164.312(a)(2)(iv)
    - id: "SEC-005"
      description: "Implement audit controls recording all PHI access"
      implementation_guidance: >
        Log all access to PHI including: user ID, timestamp, action performed,
        records accessed, success/failure. Retain audit logs for minimum 6 years.
        Logs must be tamper-evident.
        Reference: §164.312(b)
    - id: "SEC-006"
      description: "Protect PHI integrity with authentication mechanisms"
      implementation_guidance: >
        Implement mechanisms to verify PHI has not been improperly altered or destroyed.
        Use checksums, digital signatures, or database integrity constraints.
        Reference: §164.312(c)(1)
    - id: "SEC-007"
      description: "Encrypt PHI in transit"
      implementation_guidance: >
        Use TLS 1.2 or higher for all PHI transmission. Internal service-to-service
        communication carrying PHI must also be encrypted. No PHI over unencrypted
        channels (HTTP, unencrypted email, FTP).
        Reference: §164.312(e)(1)
