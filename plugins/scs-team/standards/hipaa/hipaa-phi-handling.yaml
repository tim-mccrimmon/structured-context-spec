description: "Protected Health Information identification, minimum necessary principle, and permitted uses and disclosures under HIPAA Privacy Rule"

content:
  standard: "HIPAA"
  standard_version: "As amended by HITECH Act"
  scope: "Privacy Rule (45 CFR Part 160 and Subparts A and E of Part 164)"

  requirements:
    - id: "PHI-001"
      description: "Identify all 18 HIPAA identifiers in system data"
      implementation_guidance: >
        Map every data field to the 18 HIPAA identifiers: names, geographic data smaller than state,
        dates (except year) related to an individual, phone numbers, fax numbers, email addresses,
        SSNs, medical record numbers, health plan beneficiary numbers, account numbers,
        certificate/license numbers, vehicle identifiers, device identifiers, web URLs, IP addresses,
        biometric identifiers, full-face photos, any other unique identifying number.
    - id: "PHI-002"
      description: "Apply minimum necessary standard to all PHI access"
      implementation_guidance: >
        Limit PHI disclosure to the minimum amount needed for the intended purpose.
        Implement role-based access so each role only sees PHI relevant to their function.
        API endpoints must not return PHI fields unless explicitly needed for the request.
    - id: "PHI-003"
      description: "Restrict PHI use to permitted purposes"
      implementation_guidance: >
        PHI may only be used for: treatment, payment, healthcare operations,
        as authorized by the individual, or as required by law.
        All other uses require explicit patient authorization.
    - id: "PHI-004"
      description: "Never log PHI to application logs"
      implementation_guidance: >
        Audit logs must record WHO accessed WHAT (by record ID, not PHI content),
        WHEN, and WHY. Application logs, error logs, and debug output must never
        contain PHI. Use tokenized references instead of actual PHI values in logs.
    - id: "PHI-005"
      description: "Support de-identification when PHI is used for analytics"
      implementation_guidance: >
        Use Safe Harbor method (remove all 18 identifiers) or Expert Determination
        method (statistical/scientific assessment). Document which method is used
        and maintain de-identification audit trail.
