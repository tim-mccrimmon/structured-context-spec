  scope: "CC6: Logical and Physical Access Controls, CC7: System Operations, CC8: Change Management"

  requirements:
    - id: "SOC2-SEC-001"
      description: "Implement logical access controls (CC6.1)"
      implementation_guidance: >
        Restrict system access to authorized users. Implement authentication
        mechanisms (MFA recommended), role-based access control, and least-privilege
        principles. Review access rights quarterly.
    - id: "SOC2-SEC-002"
      description: "Manage user lifecycle (CC6.2)"
      implementation_guidance: >
        Implement processes for provisioning, modifying, and revoking access.
        Disable accounts within 24 hours of termination. Require manager approval
        for access grants. Maintain access request records.
    - id: "SOC2-SEC-003"
      description: "Restrict physical access to facilities (CC6.4)"
      implementation_guidance: >
        Control physical access to data centers and server rooms.
        For cloud deployments, verify provider's SOC 2 report covers physical controls.
        Maintain visitor logs and escort policies.
    - id: "SOC2-SEC-004"
      description: "Protect against malicious software (CC6.8)"
      implementation_guidance: >
        Deploy anti-malware controls, implement code signing for deployments,
        use dependency scanning for supply chain risks, and maintain
        vulnerability management program.
    - id: "SOC2-SEC-005"
      description: "Detect and respond to security events (CC7.2)"
      implementation_guidance: >
        Implement security monitoring (SIEM or equivalent), define alert thresholds,
        establish incident response procedures, and conduct regular security reviews.
        Log all security-relevant events.
    - id: "SOC2-SEC-006"
      description: "Manage system changes (CC8.1)"
      implementation_guidance: >
        All changes must go through change management: code review, testing,
        approval, deployment tracking. Emergency changes must be documented
        and reviewed after the fact. Maintain change log.
