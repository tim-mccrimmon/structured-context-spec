  requirements:
    - id: "SOC2-AV-001"
      description: "Define and maintain availability commitments (A1.1)"
      implementation_guidance: >
        Document availability SLAs (e.g., 99.9% uptime). Define maintenance
        windows, planned downtime procedures, and communication protocols.
        Publish status page for customers.
    - id: "SOC2-AV-002"
      description: "Implement system monitoring (A1.1)"
      implementation_guidance: >
        Monitor system health, resource utilization, and performance metrics.
        Configure alerts for threshold breaches. Implement automated health
        checks and synthetic monitoring for critical paths.
    - id: "SOC2-AV-003"
      description: "Establish incident management process (A1.2)"
      implementation_guidance: >
        Define severity levels, escalation paths, and response time targets.
        Maintain on-call rotation. Document and review all incidents.
        Track mean time to detect (MTTD) and mean time to resolve (MTTR).
    - id: "SOC2-AV-004"
      description: "Maintain disaster recovery plan (A1.2)"
      implementation_guidance: >
        Define RPO (Recovery Point Objective) and RTO (Recovery Time Objective).
        Implement automated backups. Test recovery procedures at least annually.
        Document and maintain runbooks for common failure scenarios.
    - id: "SOC2-AV-005"
      description: "Implement capacity planning (A1.1)"
      implementation_guidance: >
        Monitor resource trends, plan for growth, implement auto-scaling
        where applicable. Conduct load testing before major releases.
        Document capacity thresholds and scaling procedures.
