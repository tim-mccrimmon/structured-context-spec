content:
  standard: "SOC 2 Type II"
  standard_version: "2017 Trust Services Criteria (TSP Section 100)"
  scope: "C1: Confidentiality criteria"

  requirements:
    - id: "SOC2-CONF-001"
      description: "Classify data by sensitivity level (C1.1)"
      implementation_guidance: >
        Define data classification levels (e.g., Public, Internal, Confidential, Restricted).
        Label all data stores and document what classification applies.
        Implement handling procedures for each classification level.
    - id: "SOC2-CONF-002"
      description: "Encrypt confidential data at rest (C1.1)"
      implementation_guidance: >
        Use AES-256 or equivalent for confidential and restricted data at rest.
        Implement key management with rotation schedules. Ensure backups
        are also encrypted. Document encryption scope and any exceptions.
    - id: "SOC2-CONF-003"
      description: "Encrypt confidential data in transit (C1.1)"
      implementation_guidance: >
        Use TLS 1.2+ for all external communications. Encrypt internal
        service-to-service traffic carrying confidential data. Disable
        legacy protocols (SSL, TLS 1.0/1.1).
    - id: "SOC2-CONF-004"
      description: "Control access to confidential information (C1.2)"
      implementation_guidance: >
        Restrict access based on data classification and job function.
        Implement DLP (Data Loss Prevention) controls for high-sensitivity data.
        Monitor and alert on bulk data exports.
    - id: "SOC2-CONF-005"
      description: "Securely dispose of confidential data (C1.2)"
      implementation_guidance: >
        Define retention periods for each data classification. Implement
        secure deletion procedures (cryptographic erasure for encrypted data,
        secure wipe for unencrypted). Document disposal and maintain records.

  controls:
    - id: "SOC2-CONF-CTRL-001"
      description: "Data classification inventory"
      evidence_required: "Data classification policy, inventory of data stores with classifications, handling procedures"
    - id: "SOC2-CONF-CTRL-002"
      description: "Encryption implementation"
      evidence_required: "Encryption configuration, key management documentation, encryption coverage audit"
    - id: "SOC2-CONF-CTRL-003"
      description: "Data disposal records"
      evidence_required: "Retention schedule, disposal logs, secure deletion verification"
