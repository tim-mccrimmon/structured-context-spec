  summary: CLI tool for care coordinators to track patient medications, appointments, and daily health tasks.

  what_it_is: |
    Care Plan Tracker is an internal tool used by care coordinators within
    a healthcare organization to help patients stay on track with their care plans.

    It provides a simple command-line interface for tracking:
    - Medications (name, dosage, frequency)
    - Appointments (provider, datetime, location)
    - Daily health tasks (e.g., "check blood pressure", "walk 30 minutes")

  users:
    primary: Care coordinators (clinical staff)
    context: |
      Used during patient check-ins to review adherence and update care plans.
      Not patient-facing - coordinators use it on clinic workstations.

  data_sensitivity: |
    **Contains PHI** - patient names, medications, appointments, health tasks.
    HIPAA awareness required for all development.

    type: Internal tool (hospital/clinic)
    installation: Installed on clinic workstations
    storage: Local JSON file per user (~/.careplan/data.json)
    network: None - all operations local, no external API calls
