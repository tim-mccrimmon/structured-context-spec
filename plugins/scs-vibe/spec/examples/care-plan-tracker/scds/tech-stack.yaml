content:
  summary: Python 3.10+ CLI with Click, local JSON storage, pytest for testing.

  layers:
    - layer: Language
      technology: Python 3.10+
      notes: Type hints, dataclasses (stdlib)

    - layer: CLI Framework
      technology: Click
      notes: Cleaner than argparse, better UX for complex commands

    - layer: Data Models
      technology: dataclasses
      notes: stdlib, no ORM needed for JSON storage

    - layer: Storage
      technology: JSON file
      notes: |
        Local only (~/.careplan/data.json)
        No encryption yet - relies on workstation full-disk encryption
        Single-user, no concurrent access concerns

    - layer: Testing
      technology: pytest
      notes: Unit tests for service/storage layers

  dependencies:
    runtime:
      - click>=8.0
    dev:
      - pytest>=7.0

  not_using:
    - name: ORMs (SQLAlchemy, etc.)
      reason: Overkill for JSON file storage
    - name: async/await
      reason: No I/O concurrency needs, CLI is synchronous
    - name: External APIs
      reason: Local-only tool, no network dependencies
