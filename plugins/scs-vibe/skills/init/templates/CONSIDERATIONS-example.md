## Universal

### Privacy Policy
**Decision:** N/A
**Rationale:** Internal tool used only by organization employees. Covered by existing employee data policies.

### Terms of Service
**Decision:** N/A
**Rationale:** Internal tool, not offered to external users.

### Cookie Consent
**Decision:** N/A
**Rationale:** CLI application, no cookies.

### Contact Information
**Decision:** Already Done
**Notes:** IT help desk is the contact point for internal tools.

---

## User Data

### GDPR Compliance
**Decision:** N/A
**Rationale:** US-only deployment, no EU patient data.

### CCPA Compliance
**Decision:** Will Address
**Notes:** Organization operates in California. Need to verify patient rights procedures align with CCPA requirements. Target: Before v1.1.

### Data Retention Policy
**Decision:** Will Address
**Notes:** Need to define retention period for care plan logs. Clinical team to determine appropriate period based on care coordination needs.

### Breach Notification
**Decision:** Already Done
**Notes:** Organization has existing breach notification procedures. This tool falls under existing policies.

### Data Minimization
**Decision:** Accepted Risk
**Rationale:** Storing full medication and appointment details for care coordination. More than strictly necessary for adherence tracking, but required for clinical utility. Clinical lead approved.

### Secure Deletion
**Decision:** N/A
**Rationale:** Patient data deletion handled through organization's existing EHR procedures. This tool is supplementary.

---

## Authentication

### Password Security
**Decision:** N/A
**Rationale:** No application-level authentication. Access controlled by workstation login (organization SSO).

### Session Management
**Decision:** N/A
**Rationale:** CLI tool, no sessions.

### Credential Storage
**Decision:** N/A
**Rationale:** No credentials stored by application.

### Account Recovery
**Decision:** N/A
**Rationale:** No application-level accounts.

---

## Healthcare

### HIPAA Applicability
**Decision:** Already Done
**Notes:** Organization is a covered entity (healthcare provider). Tool used by workforce members (care coordinators) for treatment purposes. HIPAA applies.

### PHI Identification
**Decision:** Already Done
**Notes:** PHI in this system: patient name, medications (name, dosage, frequency), appointments (provider, datetime, location), care tasks. Stored in `~/.careplan/data.json`.

### Encryption at Rest
**Decision:** Accepted Risk
**Rationale:** v1 stores local JSON without app-level encryption. HOWEVER:
- Clinic workstations have full-disk encryption (BitLocker) per IT policy
- Physical access is controlled (badge entry)
- Tool is single-user, no network access
- Will implement app-level encryption in v2 before any multi-workstation features

**Risk Owner:** Tim McCrimmon (Project Lead)
**Review Date:** Before v2 release

### Encryption in Transit
**Decision:** N/A (for v1)
**Rationale:** No network communication in v1. Local file storage only. This will change if network features are added.

### Access Controls
**Decision:** Will Address
**Notes:** Currently relies on workstation-level access control. Need to add user identification to audit logs (which care coordinator accessed which patient).

### Audit Logging
**Decision:** Will Address
**Notes:** v1 does not have audit logging for PHI access. Required for HIPAA compliance. Priority item for v1.1.

Implementation plan:
- Log every read/write of patient data
- Include: user (from workstation), timestamp, action, patient ID
- Separate audit log file, append-only

### BAA Requirements
**Decision:** Accepted Risk
**Rationale:** No third-party vendors involved in v1. Local storage only. No BAAs needed currently.

If adding cloud backup, vendor integrations, or SaaS features: **STOP** - BAA required first.

## Infrastructure & Security

### HTTPS Everywhere
**Decision:** N/A
**Rationale:** No network communication in v1.

### Secrets Management
**Decision:** Already Done
**Notes:** No secrets in codebase. No API keys, no credentials.

### Dependency Security
**Decision:** Will Address
**Notes:** Set up dependabot or similar for vulnerability scanning. Currently only dependency is Click.

### Backup Strategy
**Decision:** Accepted Risk
**Rationale:** Local JSON file, no application-level backup. Workstations are backed up nightly by IT. If local file is lost, data is lost since last IT backup.

Acceptable for v1 (supplementary tool). If this becomes primary system of record, need dedicated backup strategy.

### Incident Response
**Decision:** Will Address
**Notes:** Define what happens if:
- Data file is corrupted
- Unauthorized access is suspected
- Patient requests data deletion

Link to organization's existing incident response procedures.

## Action Items

### Before v1 Launch
- [x] Verify workstation encryption policy with IT
- [ ] Add user identification to data model for audit trail
- [ ] Define data retention period with clinical team
- [ ] Document incident response procedures

### Before v1.1
- [ ] Implement audit logging for PHI access
- [ ] Verify CCPA alignment with compliance team
- [ ] Set up dependency vulnerability scanning

### Before v2 (if network features added)
- [ ] Implement app-level encryption at rest
- [ ] Add encryption in transit (TLS)
- [ ] BAA with any cloud vendors
- [ ] Full security review
