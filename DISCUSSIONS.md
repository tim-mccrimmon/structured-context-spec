# How to Engage in SCS Discussions

SCS is intentionally a **discussion-first specification**.
We value thoughtful disagreement more than quick consensus.

---

## Where to Start

Use **GitHub Discussions** for:
- foundational questions (“what is context?”)
- boundary debates (prompt vs context vs RAG vs memory)
- critiques of the current model
- alternative formulations or counterexamples

Use **Issues** for:
- unclear language
- schema problems
- missing examples
- validation gaps

Use **RFCs** for:
- breaking changes
- new core concepts
- structural redesigns

## How to Disagree Productively

Good contributions usually include:
- a concrete example
- a counterexample that breaks the current model
- a proposed boundary (“this belongs elsewhere”)
- tradeoff analysis

Bad contributions usually:
- restate preferences without examples
- argue tooling choices instead of concepts
- propose large changes without motivation

## Tone Expectations

- Be precise, not performative
- Assume good intent
- Critique ideas, not people
- This is not a product support channel

If something feels out of scope, say so — scope clarity is a feature.
