# Business Context & Opportunity Brief

## 1. Problem Overview
Medication non-adherence remains one of the most persistent and costly problems in healthcare. Across post-operative, chronic, and transitional care populations, adherence rates commonly fall below 50%. This leads to avoidable complications, readmissions, reduced quality scores, and significant financial penalties for providers participating in value-based care programs.

Existing solutions—such as basic reminder apps, one-way SMS systems, or manual outreach—are fragmented and insufficient. They fail to engage patients, lack clinical integration, and do not surface actionable insights for providers. As a result, clinicians struggle to intervene early, and patients lack timely, personalized support.

This initiative seeks to address these gaps with a streamlined, scalable, clinically connected adherence platform.

## 2. Target Users & Stakeholders
**Primary users:**  
- **Patients** recovering from procedures or managing chronic conditions who require structured medication schedules, reminders, and support.
  
**Secondary users:**  
- **Clinicians** who need visibility into adherence patterns, risk flags, and high-priority outreach opportunities.  
- **Care coordinators and navigators** who support follow-up, education, and intervention workflows.  
- **Administrators** who monitor quality metrics and performance outcomes.

Each group faces friction today: patients struggle with timing and instructions, providers lack real-time adherence data, and care teams have limited tools for proactive outreach.

## 3. Why Now
Three converging factors create urgency:
1. **Shift to value-based care** increases penalties for poor adherence and readmissions.  
2. **Consumer expectations** for mobile-first, personalized health engagement have risen sharply.  
3. **Increasing regulatory visibility** around care quality requires improved adherence documentation and measurable outcomes.

Health systems and payers are actively seeking adherence solutions with stronger clinical integration and higher patient engagement. The window to establish a foothold is open but narrowing.

## 4. Opportunity Summary
A unified adherence platform could position the organization as a partner in improving outcomes, reducing costs, and enhancing patient engagement. The opportunity includes:
- Differentiation through EHR-integrated adherence data.  
- A scalable model that supports surgical care, chronic conditions, and pharmacy workflows.  
- A compelling value story for health systems and payers.

The initiative aligns with strategic goals to deepen clinical partnerships, expand patient-facing capabilities, and support quality-of-care metrics.

## 5. Desired Business Outcomes
The product aims to:
- Reduce medication-related complications and readmissions in targeted patient groups.  
- Improve adherence metrics by 20–30% within pilot populations.  
- Provide actionable visibility for clinicians and care teams.  
- Strengthen health system relationships through measurable quality improvements.  
- Expand the company’s footprint in patient engagement and continuity-of-care offerings.

## 6. Guiding Principles & Vision
The platform will be:
- **Simple and intuitive** for patients of all ages and digital literacy levels.  
- **Clinically meaningful**, not just a reminder tool.  
- **Integrated**, aligning with provider workflows and data systems.  
- **Insight-driven**, surfacing adherence risks early.  
- **Privacy- and security-first** by design.

The product should *support and empower* patients, not overwhelm them with complexity.

## 7. Key Assumptions
- Patients will engage when provided a clear, supportive experience with minimal friction.  
- Providers will adopt the system if adherence data is accessible in their existing workflow.  
- Integration with common EHR systems is feasible using established standards.  
- A lightweight, mobile-first experience is sufficient for early phases.

## 8. Constraints
- Clinical accuracy and safety requirements will shape messaging and escalation workflows.  
- Integration timelines for EHR systems may impact rollout.  
- Budget and staffing for patient support teams may vary across customers.  
- Accessibility standards must be met across device types and patient ages.

## 9. High-Level Solution Direction
The platform will provide:
- A patient-facing mobile experience with reminders, schedules, simple check-ins, and clarity about dosage and timing.  
- A provider-facing dashboard or embedded panel displaying real-time adherence patterns and risk flags.  
- Alerting and routing logic that escalates non-adherence signals to care coordinators.  
- Analytics for administrators evaluating program effectiveness.

The solution prioritizes early wins in post-operative use cases while establishing a foundation for chronic care expansion.

## 10. Success Metrics
- Adherence improvement in target populations (measured via check-ins, refill events, and outcomes data).  
- Reduction in readmissions or complications attributable to missed medication.  
- Provider adoption and repeated use of adherence dashboards.  
- Patient engagement metrics (completion rates, reminder responsiveness, check-in frequency).  
- ROI demonstrated for health systems within 6–12 months after implementation.
