# Ethics & AI Accountability Domain

## Overview
The Ethics & AI Accountability domain defines ethical considerations, AI/ML governance, bias mitigation, explainability, and accountability mechanisms. It ensures AI systems are used ethically and responsibly with appropriate human oversight.

## Domain Owner
**Typical Role:** AI Ethics Lead / ML Engineer / Product Manager
**Responsibilities:**
- Define AI ethics framework and principles
- Establish bias detection and mitigation strategies
- Define explainability and interpretability requirements
- Establish accountability and human oversight mechanisms
- Ensure responsible AI practices

## Generated SCDs
This domain produces 4 SCDs:
1. **scd:project:ai-ethics-framework** - Ethical principles for AI/ML usage
2. **scd:project:bias-mitigation** - How bias is detected, measured, and mitigated
3. **scd:project:explainability-approach** - How AI decisions are made explainable and interpretable
4. **scd:project:accountability-mechanisms** - Human oversight, audit trails, accountability

## Templates to Complete
- **ethics-and-ai-accountability-brief-template.md** - Complete AI ethics and accountability context

## How to Complete
1. **Prerequisite:** Review domains to understand AI/ML usage:
   - business-context (understand AI use cases and impact)
   - data-provenance (understand training data and data quality)
   - compliance-governance (understand regulatory requirements for AI)

2. **Gather information from:**
   - ML/AI team (models, algorithms, training data)
   - Product team (AI use cases, user impact)
   - Legal/Compliance team (AI regulations)
   - Ethics committee (ethical guidelines)

3. **Define AI ethics approach:**
   - Ethical principles and values
   - Bias detection and mitigation
   - Explainability requirements
   - Human oversight and accountability

4. **Move to completed:**
   - Place finished template in `../../intent/completed/ethics-ai-accountability/`

## Dependencies
- **Prerequisite domains:**
  - business-context (understand AI use cases)
  - data-provenance (understand training data)
  - compliance-governance (AI regulations)
- **Provides context to:**
  - testing-validation (bias testing, explainability testing)
  - deployment-operations (AI model monitoring)
  - compliance-governance (AI compliance requirements)

## Workflow Position
**SECOND WAVE** - Can begin after business-context, data-provenance, and compliance are understood. Critical for AI/ML systems.

**Note:** For systems without AI/ML components, this domain may have minimal content or can be customized via `.scs/completeness-rules.yaml`.

## What Happens Next
Your completed template generates 4 AI ethics and accountability SCDs that establish responsible AI practices and governance.

## Template Version
- Version: 0.2.0
- Last Updated: 2025-01-26
