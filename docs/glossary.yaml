terms:
  context:
    label: Context
    short: The information humans or AI rely on to understand what a system is and
      how it must operate.
    medium: Context is the information humans or AI use to understand system behavior,
      constraints, boundaries, and intent. For AI, context exists only in the text
      within its context window.
  project_context:
    label: Project Context
    short: The durable environment of constraints, intent, rules, and boundaries governing
      all work.
    medium: Project Context is the long-lived environment of intent, constraints,
      definitions, and boundaries that govern how a system must be built. It shapes
      all developer and AI behavior.
  task_context:
    label: Task Context
    short: The immediate instruction for a specific action.
    medium: Task Context defines a specific instruction—such as generating a function
      or writing a test. It does not describe the broader environment or constraints
      of the system.
  operating_environment:
    label: Operating Environment (AI Development)
    short: The explicit rules and constraints an AI must follow.
    medium: The operating environment is the structured set of rules, boundaries,
      and constraints that guide AI during development tasks. SCS formalizes this
      environment.
  constraint:
    label: Constraint
    short: A non-negotiable rule governing system behavior.
    medium: Constraints define rules that must be respected during development—security
      rules, data handling limits, architectural decisions, compliance requirements,
      and more.
  boundary:
    label: Boundary
    short: Defines what is inside vs. outside the system's scope.
    medium: A boundary clarifies what the solution controls and what it does not.
      Boundaries prevent drift and anchor architectural and domain reasoning.
  shared_baseline:
    label: Shared Baseline
    short: A unified understanding that all contributors operate from.
    medium: A shared baseline ensures humans and AI agents start from the same authoritative
      understanding of system rules, constraints, and intent.
  alignment:
    label: Alignment
    short: Human and AI contributors producing coherent, consistent work.
    medium: Alignment occurs when AI and humans interpret and apply the same constraints,
      rules, and boundaries—reducing rework and drift.
  drift:
    label: Context Drift
    short: Unintended divergence between intended and actual output.
    medium: Context Drift occurs when development output deviates from declared intent,
      rules, or architecture due to missing, outdated, or inconsistent context.
  salience:
    label: Salience
    short: The model's ability to recognize and prioritize key information.
    medium: Salience determines how effectively an AI system identifies and applies
      important constraints. SCS increases salience by providing compact, structured
      context.
  compactness_principle:
    label: Compactness Principle
    short: Smaller structured context yields better AI performance.
    medium: LLMs perform best when essential context is concise, structured, and highly
      salient. SCS is intentionally compact to fit comfortably within context windows.
  structured_context:
    label: Structured Context (SCS)
    short: A minimal, machine-readable baseline for alignment.
    medium: SCS is a standardized, compact representation of a project's essential
      intent, constraints, boundaries, and architecture. It defines the environment—not
      the implementation.
  contract:
    label: SCS Contract
    short: The authoritative versioned environment governing development.
    medium: The SCS Contract is the versioned bundle of SCDs that defines all rules,
      constraints, and boundaries. It serves as the governing environment for all
      development work.
  governed_context:
    label: Governed Context
    short: Context that has been validated and versioned.
    medium: Governed Context is fully validated and versioned SCS. It prevents drift,
      stabilizes Build Phase behavior, and enables governance.
  scd:
    label: SCD (Structured Context Document)
    short: An atomic definition of a single essential element.
    medium: An SCD expresses exactly one idea—a rule, boundary, constraint, interface,
      domain concept, or architectural requirement. SCDs compose into Bundles.
  meta_scd:
    label: Meta SCD
    short: Defines the rules of SCS itself.
    medium: Meta SCDs specify schemas, required fields, semantics, and validation
      rules that govern the SCS format.
  standard_scd:
    label: Standard SCD
    short: Reusable organizational or domain best-practice constraints.
    medium: Standard SCDs formalize proven patterns, industry rules, compliance requirements,
      and enterprise architecture principles.
  project_scd:
    label: Project SCD
    short: A system-specific rule or definition.
    medium: Project SCDs express the unique constraints, definitions, and boundaries
      of a particular system.
  bundle:
    label: Bundle
    short: A versioned manifest of SCDs.
    medium: A Bundle assembles SCDs into a coherent operating environment. Bundles
      are validated, versioned, and loaded into AI tools during Build.
  bundle_types:
    label: Bundle Types
    short: The four types of bundles in SCS.
    medium: SCS defines four bundle types—Project (top-level orchestrator), Meta
      (SCS foundation), Standards (compliance), and Domain (concern areas). Each
      type has specific rules about what it can contain and import.
  project_bundle:
    label: Project Bundle
    short: The top-level orchestrator bundle for a system.
    medium: The Project Bundle imports all required bundles (meta, standards, and
      domain bundles) to form the complete operating environment. It contains imports
      only, no SCDs directly. Cardinality is 1 per project.
  meta_bundle:
    label: Meta Bundle
    short: Foundational SCS vocabulary and structure.
    medium: The Meta Bundle provides the semantic foundation and structural rules
      of SCS itself. It contains meta-tier SCDs and is imported from the SCS specification.
      Cardinality is 1 per project.
  standards_bundle:
    label: Standards Bundle
    short: Compliance and regulatory requirements.
    medium: The Standards Bundle captures compliance frameworks and regulatory requirements.
      It may import other standards bundles (e.g., HIPAA, SOC2) or contain standards-tier
      SCDs directly. Cardinality is 1 per project.
  domain_bundle:
    label: Domain Bundle
    short: Organizes project-tier SCDs by concern area.
    medium: Domain Bundles organize project-tier SCDs by concern area (architecture,
      security, performance, etc.) using patterns derived from enterprise frameworks
      like TOGAF, Zachman, FEAF, ISO/IEC 25010, and NIST RMF. Every project requires
      11 prescribed domain bundles (minimum). Domain bundles contain SCDs only, no
      imports.
  prescribed_domains:
    label: Prescribed Domains
    short: The 11 required domain bundles.
    medium: SCS prescribes 11 domain bundles for production projects—Architecture,
      Security, Performance & Reliability, Usability & Accessibility, Compliance
      & Governance, Data & Provenance, Testing & Validation, Deployment & Operations,
      Safety & Risk, Ethics & AI Accountability, and Business Context.
  autonomic_governance:
    label: Autonomic Governance
    short: Future automated constraint checking.
    medium: Autonomic Governance is a future capability where AI verifies constraints,
      detects drift, and enforces compliance using structured context.
  governance_boundary:
    label: Governance Boundary
    short: Zone where constraints must be enforced.
    medium: A governance boundary defines areas—such as data access or dependency
      rules—where enforcement is required.
  ai_alignment:
    label: AI Alignment
    short: AI working from the same context as the team.
    medium: AI alignment ensures all agents consume and respect the versioned project
      bundle, preventing hallucinations and rule violations.
  context_window_efficiency:
    label: Context Window Efficiency
    short: Keeping context compact enough for effective reasoning.
    medium: Efficiency ensures context fits comfortably alongside prompts, code, and
      conversation within an LLM context window.
  bundle_loader:
    label: Bundle Loader
    short: Component that injects bundles into AI systems.
    medium: The Bundle Loader ensures AI agents receive the correct versioned context
      before generating or modifying code.
  scs_cli:
    label: SCS-CLI
    short: The tool for creating and validating SCS artifacts.
    medium: SCS-CLI provides commands to create, inspect, diff, validate, and explain
      SCDs and Bundles.
