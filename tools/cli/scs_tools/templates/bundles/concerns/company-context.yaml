# Concern Bundle Template: Company Context
# Type: concern
# Owner: CEO
# Purpose: Company-specific context that doesn't fit in other concerns
#
# This concern bundle contains company overview, values, stakeholders, and
# business model information. It's imported by the company's Domain Bundle.
#
# BUNDLE TYPE RULES FOR CONCERNS:
# - MUST have at least one SCD in the 'scds' array
# - MUST have empty 'imports' array (concerns are leaf nodes, don't import)
# - All SCDs should be project-tier (scd:project:*)

id: bundle:[company-name]-company-context
type: concern
version: "DRAFT"
title: "[Company Name] - Company Context"
description: >
  Company-specific context for [Company Name] including mission, vision,
  values, stakeholders, and business model. This concern provides business
  and organizational context that doesn't fit in technical concerns
  (Architecture, Security, etc.).

# SCDs contained in this bundle
# At minimum, include company-overview
# Optionally split into multiple SCDs for granular control
scds:
  - scd:project:company-overview
  # Optional: Add more SCDs if you split company context into multiple files
  # - scd:project:company-values
  # - scd:project:stakeholders
  # - scd:project:business-model

# Imports: MUST be empty for concern bundles
# Concerns are leaf nodes in the bundle hierarchy
imports: []

  rationale: >
    Company-context concern bundle for [Company Name]. This bundle is
    imported by the [Company Name] domain bundle to provide company-specific
    context to all projects within the organization.

# Usage Notes:
# 1. Replace [company-name] and [Company Name] throughout
# 2. Start with DRAFT version during development
# 3. Create at least one company-overview SCD
# 4. Validate with: scs validate [this-file].yaml
# 5. When ready, version with: scs bundle version [this-file].yaml --version 1.0.0
# 6. Deploy with: scs deploy [versioned-bundle].yaml --to [mcp-server]
#
# Design Decisions:
# - Single SCD (company-overview): Simpler, atomic versioning
# - Multiple SCDs: Granular control, independent versioning, selective sharing
# - Recommendation: Start with single SCD, split later if needed
#
# This bundle will be imported by:
# - Your company's Domain Bundle (bundle:[company-name])
# - Which is imported by your Project Bundles
