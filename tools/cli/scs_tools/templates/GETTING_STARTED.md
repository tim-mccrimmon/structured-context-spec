# Getting Started with {{ project_name }}

Welcome to your SCS-structured project! This guide will help you understand and work with your project's structured context.

## What is SCS?

The Structured Context Specification (SCS) is a framework for organizing project context, requirements, and compliance information in a machine-readable, version-controlled format.

## Understanding Your Project Structure

### Bundles

Bundles are collections of related SCDs (Structured Context Documents). Your project has three types of bundles:

1. **Project Bundle** (`bundles/project-bundle.yaml`): The top-level bundle that imports all other bundles
2. **Meta Bundle** (`bundles/meta-bundle.yaml`): Contains core SCS vocabulary (imported from the SCS spec)
3. **Domain Bundles** (`bundles/domains/*.yaml`): Organize SCDs by domain (architecture, security, etc.)

### SCDs (Structured Context Documents)

SCDs are YAML files that contain specific project information. They live in `context/project/` and are organized into domains:

{% for bundle in bundles -%}
#### {{ bundle | title }}
{% endfor %}

## Editing Your Project Context

### Step 1: Start with Core SCDs

Begin by editing these essential SCDs:

1. **System Context** (`context/project/system-context.yaml`)
   - Define what your system does
   - List external actors and systems
   - Describe key data flows

2. **Tech Stack** (`context/project/tech-stack.yaml`)
   - List your languages, frameworks, and tools
   - Document technology choices and rationale

3. **Data Model** (`context/project/data-model.yaml`)
   - Define your core data entities
   - Document relationships and constraints

### Step 2: Fill in Domain-Specific SCDs

Work through each domain bundle and edit the relevant SCDs:

- **Security**: Authentication, data protection, threat model
- **Compliance**: Regulatory requirements (HIPAA, SOC2, etc.)
- **Testing**: Test coverage, validation plans, QA procedures
- **Operations**: Infrastructure, observability, incident response

### Step 3: Review and Refine

- Review bundles to ensure all SCDs are referenced
- Check that SCD IDs match the file structure
- Validate that provenance information is accurate

## SCD Format

Each SCD has this structure:

```yaml
id: scd:project:example-scd
type: project
version: "1.0.0"
status: DRAFT              # DRAFT | ACTIVE | DEPRECATED
title: "Example SCD"
description: "Description of what this SCD covers"

domain: example-domain
concerns:
  - concern-1
  - concern-2

content:
  # Your actual content goes here
  # This is the heart of the SCD

provenance:
  created_by: "email@example.com"
  created_at: "2025-01-01T00:00:00Z"
  rationale: "Why this SCD exists"
```

## Working with SCS Status

SCDs have three statuses:

- **DRAFT**: Still being developed, content may change
- **ACTIVE**: Finalized and in use
- **DEPRECATED**: No longer current, kept for historical reference

Start with all SCDs in DRAFT status. Move to ACTIVE when you're confident the content is accurate and complete.

## Next Steps

1. **Customize SCDs**: Replace placeholder content with your actual project information
2. **Add More SCDs**: Create additional SCDs as your project needs them
3. **Version Control**: Commit your changes to track evolution over time
4. **Review Regularly**: Keep SCDs up-to-date as your project evolves

## SCS Project Type: {{ project_type }}

Your project is configured as a **{{ project_type }}** project, which includes:

{% if project_type == 'healthcare' -%}
- HIPAA compliance requirements
- CHAI (Coalition for Health AI) adherence
- TEFCA participation (if applicable)
- Healthcare-specific security and privacy controls
{% elif project_type == 'fintech' -%}
- PCI-DSS compliance
- SOX controls
- Financial services security requirements
{% elif project_type == 'saas' -%}
- GDPR compliance
- SOC 2 controls
- Multi-tenancy considerations
{% elif project_type == 'minimal' -%}
- Essential architecture SCDs
- Core security requirements
- Basic deployment and operations
{% else -%}
- Standard compliance and governance
- Complete domain coverage
{% endif %}
