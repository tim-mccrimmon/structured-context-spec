relationships:
  # Define how this SCD relates to others in your project.
  # Relationship types: depends-on, satisfies, constrains, refines, extends, conflicts-with, implements
  #
  # Component Model typically depends on system context and is constrained by security/compliance.
  # Example relationships:
  - type: "refines"
    target: "scd:project:system-context"
    description: "Component model refines high-level system boundaries"
  - type: "depends-on"
    target: "scd:project:tech-stack"
    description: "Component design depends on technology choices"
  # - type: "satisfies"
  #   target: "scd:standards:hipaa-compliance"
  #   description: "Component boundaries satisfy PHI isolation requirements"
