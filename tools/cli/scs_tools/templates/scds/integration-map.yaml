relationships:
  # Define how this SCD relates to others in your project.
  # Relationship types: depends-on, satisfies, constrains, refines, extends, conflicts-with, implements
  #
  # Integration Map depends on architecture and is constrained by security/data policies.
  # Example relationships:
  - type: "refines"
    target: "scd:project:system-context"
    description: "Integration map details external system interactions"
  - type: "depends-on"
    target: "scd:project:component-model"
    description: "Integrations connect to specific components"
  - type: "depends-on"
    target: "scd:project:authn-authz"
    description: "Integration authentication follows security model"
  # - type: "satisfies"
  #   target: "scd:project:data-handling"
